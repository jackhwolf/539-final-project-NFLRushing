# 539 Final Project

I wrote some code so that to run experiments all we need to do is build some pytorch models and use the skeleton I prepared. Look at `script.py` for an example. This will run two experiments for each of the parameters I gave it and save the results to a file in the `Results` directory. 

Mostly what is left is writing more models. Write these in the `models` directory and name the class and filename the same thing. Then you can use the `run_experiment` function like I didn in `script.py` to test it with different parameters and data setups.  - jack
